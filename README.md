Objective: Graph the relationship between the variables we choose against the vaccination status.
3 variables that affect vax status : Age, Income, Education.
Age:

Income:

Education: level may be considered an overrated factor when determining whether a person has got a vaccine or not. I believe this to be the case as on paper, it may seem as though the higher the education level a person obtains, the more likely it is that they get the vaccine but that may not be the case as they may have some alternate beliefs. 

Gender: an underrated factor may be as it may seem as though that being a certain gender has no impact on whether a person will opt in or out of the vaccination rule but that may not be the case. There have been studies that show that women are more hesitant to take the vaccine as there are concerns about the side effects to fertility, breastfeeding and hormonal changes.

Table:
Age, Education, Income, Vaccination status.

Graph for each variable:
Age           -> Vac status
Income      -> Vac status
Education  -> Vac status

We will now present our code that visually depicts the relationship between our variables that affect vax status against the vax status itself:

Based on the Vax Status vs. Education graph,  we can conclude that the higher degree a person obtains, the more likely it is for them to get a Vaccine. The majority of people who did not get the vaccine were from people who had a high school diploma and lower.

Based on the Vax Status vs. Birth Year graph, we concluded that a majority of people who got the vaccine were born between the years of 1950-2000 while the majority of people who did not get the vaccine were born before 1950 and were born after 2010.

Based on the Vax Status vs Income Graph,  in terms of proportions, there seems to be no difference between the number of people who did not get the vax vs. who got the vax as in each income bracket, the number of people who got the vax massively outnumber the people who did not.
